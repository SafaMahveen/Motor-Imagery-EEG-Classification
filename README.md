# Motor-Imagery-EEG-Classification
This project implements deep learning models (VAE, DAE, and CNN-LSTM) to classify motor imagery EEG signals into imagined movements: Left Hand, Right Hand, Left Foot, and Right Foot. The system processes raw EEG data, removes noise, extracts key features, and predicts movement using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline.
